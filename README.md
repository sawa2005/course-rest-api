# Simple REST web service
This is a simple REST web service that I've developed to learn more about the subject. It lets you create, read, update and delete courses from a database.
These courses are courses I've completed in my education.

The published web service can be found from this link: http://samuelwarduppgifter.one/rest/rest.php
