# Moment 5 (Part 1) - Create a REST web service
This is a REST web service that I've developed. It lets you create, read, update and delete courses from a database.
These courses are courses I've completed in my education.

The web service can be found from this link: http://samuelwarduppgifter.one/rest/rest.php
